                    Hello, I am Habeeb Makusota, a software engineer based in Lagos, Nigeria. I am passionate about writing elegant code to enable easy extendabilty and maintenance. Iâ€™m highly skilled in building functional applications and can comfortably translate design mockups into responsive pixel-perfect web and/or mobile screens to bring designs to life. In my spare time I read articles to help my growth, watch movies, hang out with friends.
